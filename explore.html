                    Mullaghmeen Forest
                </h2>
                <p> Mullaghmeen Forest is the largest planted beech forest in Ireland. Along with beech, within its 400
                    ha of forest it also has Sitka spruce, Scots pine and Noble fir and a very interesting native tree
                    collection. This is well worth a stop on the Mullaghmeen Summit Trail / Red Trail. The summit of
                    Mullaghmeen provides magnificent views north across Lough Sheelin and into the neighbouring county
                    of Cavan.
                    The forest, once an out farm belonging to a Lord Gradwell, has many examples of the former impacts
                    on the landscape. Following the White Trail one passes sad reminders of famine times with relic
                    walls of famine fields. A Booley Hut, a summer grazing shelter is just off the Red Walk /
                    Mullaghmeen Summit Trail, while the Flax Pits show that this important crop for the linen industry
                    was once harvested and cured in this area.
                    The area has an extensive network of way marked trails for varying levels of fitness.</p>

                <h2>Loughcrew Cairn</h2>
                <p>Loughcrew or Lough Crew (Irish: Loch Craobh, meaning "lake of the tree") is an area of historical
                    importance near Oldcastle, County Meath, Ireland. It is home to a group of ancient tombs from the
                    4th millennium BC, some decorated with rare megalithic art, which sit on top of a range of hills.
                    The hills and tombs are together known as Slieve na Calliagh (Sliabh na Caill√≠) and are the
                    highest point in Meath. It is one of the four main passage tomb cemeteries in Ireland and is a
                    protected National Monument. The area is also home to the Loughcrew Estate, from which it is named.
