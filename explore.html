                <h2>Crover House</h2>
                <p>Crover House is an award-winning Four Star Hotel that was built in the 18th Century and is nestled in
                    the most beautiful Cavan countryside. Set in peaceful and idyllic surroundings on the shores of
                    Lough Sheelin and conveniently located only a stone’s throw away from Dublin and border counties.

                    This Georgian Manor House, resting majestically on the private shores of Lough Sheelin, emanates
                    elegance and class with breathtaking views of the historic lake and 41 acres of meticulously
                    landscaped grounds. The House provides an intimate and tranquil setting for romantic getaways,
                    weddings, golfing, fishing and much more.

                    First constructed in 1759 by the Maxwell Family, one of the largest landowners in Ireland, Crover
                    House has a fascinating history.

                    Serving as a Country Estate to prestigious Reverends, Lords, Barons and Colonels until 1957 when
                    Crover House opened its doors as a hotel.

                <h2>Mountnugent Village</h2>
                <p>Mountnugent is a charming village beautifully situated on the River Inny and the eastern shores of
                    Lough Sheelin.
                    The village's more recent name of Mountnugent comes from a local branch of the Nugent family,
                    originally an Anglo-Norman family who were cousins of Hugh de Lacy and large landowners in Meath,
                    Cavan and Westmeath. Although the village is in County Cavan, the Roman Catholic parish of
                    Mountnugent (or Kilbride) is in the Diocese of Meath. In the Church of Ireland, Mountnugent, or
                    Kilbride Castlecor, is part of the parish of Castlepollard in the diocese of Meath and Kildare.
                    It has one public house (The Bridge Inn), one grocery shop , one fuel station and motor repair shop,
                    two churches (Roman Catholic: St Bridget's, built c. 1820; Church
                    of Ireland: St Bride's, built 1804) and one primary school.

                    Mullaghmeen Forest
                </h2>
                <p> Mullaghmeen Forest is the largest planted beech forest in Ireland. Along with beech, within its 400
                    ha of forest it also has Sitka spruce, Scots pine and Noble fir and a very interesting native tree
                    collection. This is well worth a stop on the Mullaghmeen Summit Trail / Red Trail. The summit of
                    Mullaghmeen provides magnificent views north across Lough Sheelin and into the neighbouring county
                    of Cavan.
                    The forest, once an out farm belonging to a Lord Gradwell, has many examples of the former impacts
                    on the landscape. Following the White Trail one passes sad reminders of famine times with relic
                    walls of famine fields. A Booley Hut, a summer grazing shelter is just off the Red Walk /
                    Mullaghmeen Summit Trail, while the Flax Pits show that this important crop for the linen industry
                    was once harvested and cured in this area.
                    The area has an extensive network of way marked trails for varying levels of fitness.</p>

                <h2>Loughcrew Cairn</h2>
                <p>Loughcrew or Lough Crew (Irish: Loch Craobh, meaning "lake of the tree") is an area of historical
                    importance near Oldcastle, County Meath, Ireland. It is home to a group of ancient tombs from the
                    4th millennium BC, some decorated with rare megalithic art, which sit on top of a range of hills.
                    The hills and tombs are together known as Slieve na Calliagh (Sliabh na Caillí) and are the
                    highest point in Meath. It is one of the four main passage tomb cemeteries in Ireland and is a
                    protected National Monument. The area is also home to the Loughcrew Estate, from which it is named.
