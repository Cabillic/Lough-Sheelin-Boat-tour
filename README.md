I used a French grey with subtles notes of blues for the border colours,
the header represents the Shore of the lake with the pale azure, the box shadow at the bottom of the header is like a wave using brandeis blue.

 As you go down on the page, the footer represent the deep end of the lake with a Federal blue colour.
Light blue was used for the form to be in harmony with the rest of the website.

- Overlock for the general text

- Spinnaker for all the titles
